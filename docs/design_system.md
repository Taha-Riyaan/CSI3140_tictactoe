General Design:
We chose to keep the simple, tic tac toe is a nice simple game and adding extravagent elements to it detracts for it's nature.
The board is in the center of the website.
The general structure is made using a grid, each box is 150 px, when clicked on they will produce an X in comic sans format on the box showing it has been filled. 
Afterward, the bot will then play a turn, an O will be placed in the box is chooses.
The boxes change colour on hover to indicate which on the player is going to try to select.
There is a small text at the bottom indicating when it is your turn and the outcome of the game.
The header and footer are simple keeping with the theme.
The header has the title "Tic Tac Toe" on the left side and a new game button on the right side.
On hover the new game button changes colour to indicate the user can take an action.
On clicking the new game button the game resets.
In terms of colours, we kept the board a simple black and white, for the reasons of simplicity stated above.
We chose a dark purple for the header, and a pale dark blue for the navy button, which turns a light blue on hover.
The footer is distinguished with a border line, it contains our names.
Due to the colour scheme we choose, we feel the users attnetion is focused on the center of the board to the game, where they can immediately begin playing.

Images:
We decided to implement Tic Tac Toe and decided we did not need any images as the comic sans font is excellent for the X and O's
